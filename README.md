# I have used 2 types of classification techniques in these project 
1. Decision Trees
2. Naive bayes
The Accuracy of Decision tree is 72.35% & The Accuracy of Naive bayes is 82.95% i.e. 83% approx.
That's why we have used Naive bayes technique to predict the Loan eligibility prediction in test case
